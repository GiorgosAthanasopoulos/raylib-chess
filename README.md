# Raylib Chess

A simple implementation of chess in raylib.

## NOTE 

Although the project source files have .cpp extensions the project is mainly
written in plain c, apart from the use of vectors and some algorithms,
so the structure is more c-like (which would exlpain no oop definition of the 
game logic or other c++ norms).
